## What is T.O.O.L.S.?
T.O.O.L.S. (Tools) stands for *"Typed Object-Oriented Lua System/Standard"*.

Tools is a ModuleScript that includes functionality for the Object Oriented Programming (**OOP**) paradigm for Roblox Studio.

## Why would I want to use Tools?

### Tools adds OOP to Roblox Studio, and OOP has many benefits when developing:
- Organization/Scalability
- Better Code Quality
- Better Productivity

### Tools includes built-in OOP Features:
- Classes
- Inheritance (Includes Typed inheritance)
- Design patterns (Singleton, Multiton, Abstract)
  
### Tools comes equipped with two code packages that include helpful Classes such as:
- Signal Connection Handlers (Helps mitigate memory leaks)
- Session Locked Data Stores with Auto Saving (SaveStores)
- Camera wrapper class for easier camera manipulation
- And much more!

## What makes Tools better than conventional Lua OOP?
Tools can be used as a standard for how Classes should function and be formatted in Roblox Studio

### With conventional OOP:
- You must set metatables and add metatable functionality (class definitions) to each class script
- Typed inheritance is usually not included
- Design patterns must be programmed in each class when needed

### With Tools:
- Class definition is included in Tools. If you need to change the class definition, you only need to change it in one place
- Typed inheritance is included
- Design patterns are included and can be specified through a single parameter

## How do I add Tools to my Roblox Studio Game?
There are two ways you can add Tools to your Roblox Studio
### Tools.RBXMX file (Recommended):
1. Find the Tools.RBXMX file within the GitHub Repository
2. In Roblox Studio right-click ReplicatedStorage, and choose "Insert from file..."
3. select the downloaded RBXMX file to insert Tools into Roblox Studio

### Roblox Creator Store:
